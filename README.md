## Ned Holland
My name is Ned Holland (s3794206). I can be contacted at s3794206@student.rmit.edu.au
I am a dual Canadian/Australian citizen who spent my early life in Canada before moving back to Australia 11 years ago. I play rugby union here in Brisbane and spend the majority of my spare time outdoors with my Kelpie, Rummy.

I have decided its time to kick my career into overdrive and I believe the best way to do that in todays competitive market is to sharpen my I.T skills. After researching schools and courses here in Brisbane I decided to look at the possibility of studying at RMIT after reading positive feedback about their programs.
