## Ned Holland
My name is Ned Holland (s3794206). I can be contacted at s3794206@student.rmit.edu.au

I am a dual Canadian/Australian citizen who spent my early life in Canada before moving back to Australia 11 years ago. I play rugby union here in Brisbane and spend the majority of my spare time outdoors with my Kelpie, Rummy.

I have decided its time to kick my career into overdrive and I believe the best way to do that in todays competitive market is to sharpen my I.T skills. After researching schools and courses here in Brisbane I decided to look at the possibility of studying at RMIT after reading positive feedback about their programs.

I have had a broad interest in I.T. since I was in my teens. Mainly for social, lifestyle and convenience purposes which has now evolved and become more focused as I now am beginning to realise the career progression opportunities that are presented by being fluent and well versed in more complex sides of I.T. I believe that RMIT presents a well rounded and surveyed syllabus that prepares youto be an ideal employee for the future. Equipped with a wide array of knowledge across many different forms of I.T. and the interpersonal skills required to be a success.

During my studies I hope to not only learn more skill sets within the I.T. umbrella but also gain more insight as to who I want to be and work as, in the future. I want to gain more knowledge of careers in I.T., how to progress, learn must have skills and avoid those you can do without.

## Ideal Job

I would like to use this degree as a stepping stone into a job within the data science realm. I find big data fascinating and have a passion for the insights it brings about the way people interact with the world around them. In order to achieve this I will need to excell in my current degree in order to be accepted into a masters of Data Science. I will be required to become well versed in programming languages such as R, Python and SQL. I will also be required to gain a deep understanding of machine learning and pattern recognition, all the while keeping my eye out for the next trend or technology of the future.

The following job is something I would look to work towards in the future. In this role I would be required to use my future experience in order to design and implement predictive models in order to predict future business requirements and reduce costs.

In order to be hired for a job as the one listed above I will need to find a internship during my current degree in order to gain relavent industry experience and networking. Once beginning my masters I will look to find a job in business analytics while boosting my skills in Python, R and statistics. During this time I will need to network through websites such as linkdin in order to boost my profile and display my skills and attributes.

## Project

With a reported 8.8 million arrivals to our shores in 2017 according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics it is safe to say the Australian tourism market is a hot market. With dramatic growth since 2012 there is a large market of overseas visitors arriving daily with phones in hands and cash to spend in local restaurants, bars and attractions. My goal is to develop an app which partners with local businesses to provide discounted meals, drinks and activities to visitors in the Australian major capital cities.

The app "Tabula Rasa" will direct overseas visitors to partner businesses providing discounts on food, tours and experiences. The businesses will gain not only targeted customers but will be able to purchase analytics about the customers in order to influence their future decisions and marketing campaigns. These businesses will also have an opportunity to market thier venue within the app via banners and pop ups.

Tabula Rasa will be a simple and clean app. The app will be brokendown into the following sections:

- Attractions/Experiences
- Dining
- Bars and nightlife
- Meetups

Prior to launch we will target local businesses we believe can be succesful partners and offer initial free advertising of their service in exchange for discounts for our users. We will work to offer compounded deals ie. Dinner and a movie to multiply exposure. An important aspect of the app will be using location services to show nearby deals and targeted advertising. In addition to the local deals we would like to offer a space where travellers can find others like themselves and "meetup" to take advantage of group discounts. 

Conversely our business partners will gain valuable insights into customer trends and demographics as vistiors begin to redeem the discounts. Not only will foot traffic be directed at them throught the app generating revenue but they will be able to make better decisons in the future based on the analytics gained.

After an initial consultation period to gauge interest we will need to develop a beta version of the app for testing. We will select a pool of test users to use the app and provide feedback in order to measure ease of use, functionality and desirability. If successful we will be required to create developer accounts for android/iphone so that we may publish the app. Once fully tested we will be able to integrate analytics to track user profiles and engagement as well as retention of the app. After a base of customers has been accrued and retained we will be able to monetize features on the app as well as promote ourselves and our partners within the app. 

For our initial rollout we will be using a web based app developing tool. After guaging interest it may or may not be worthwhile to invest in hiring a developer to publish Tabula Rasa.
