## Ned Holland
My name is Ned Holland (s3794206). I can be contacted at s3794206@student.rmit.edu.au

I am a dual Canadian/Australian citizen who spent my early life in Canada before moving back to Australia 11 years ago. I play rugby union here in Brisbane and spend the majority of my spare time outdoors with my Kelpie, Rummy.

I have decided its time to kick my career into overdrive and I believe the best way to do that in todays competitive market is to sharpen my I.T skills. After researching schools and courses here in Brisbane I decided to look at the possibility of studying at RMIT after reading positive feedback about their programs.

I have had a broad interest in I.T. since I was in my teens. Mainly for social, lifestyle and convenience purposes which has now evolved and become more focused as I now am beginning to realise the career progression opportunities that are presented by being fluent and well versed in more complex sides of I.T. I believe that RMIT presents a well rounded and surveyed syllabus that prepares youto be an ideal employee for the future. Equipped with a wide array of knowledge across many different forms of I.T. and the interpersonal skills required to be a success.

During my studies I hope to not only learn more skill sets within the I.T. umbrella but also gain more insight as to who I want to be and work as, in the future. I want to gain more knowledge of careers in I.T., how to progress, learn must have skills and avoid those you can do without.

## Ideal Job

I would like to use this degree as a stepping stone into a job within the data science realm. I find big data fascinating and have a passion for the insights it brings about the way people interact with the world around them. In order to achieve this I will need to excell in my current degree in order to be accepted into a masters of Data Science. I will be required to become well versed in programming languages such as R, Python and SQL. I will also be required to gain a deep understanding of machine learning and pattern recognition, all the while keeping my eye out for the next trend or technology of the future.

The following job is something I would look to work towards in the future. In this role I would be required to use my future experience in order to design and implement predictive models in order to predict future business requirements and reduce costs.

In order to be hired for a job as the one listed above I will need to find a internship during my current degree in order to gain relavent industry experience and networking. Once beginning my masters I will look to find a job in business analytics while boosting my skills in Python, R and statistics. During this time I will need to network through websites such as linkdin in order to boost my profile and display my skills and attributes.
