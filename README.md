## Ned Holland
My name is Ned Holland (s3794206). I can be contacted at s3794206@student.rmit.edu.au

I am a dual Canadian/Australian citizen who spent my early life in Canada before moving back to Australia 11 years ago. I play rugby union here in Brisbane and spend the majority of my spare time outdoors with my Kelpie, Rummy.

I have decided its time to kick my career into overdrive and I believe the best way to do that in todays competitive market is to sharpen my I.T skills. After researching schools and courses here in Brisbane I decided to look at the possibility of studying at RMIT after reading positive feedback about their programs.

I have had a broad interest in I.T. since I was in my teens. Mainly for social, lifestyle and convenience purposes which has now evolved and become more focused as I now am beginning to realise the career progression opportunities that are presented by being fluent and well versed in more complex sides of I.T. I believe that RMIT presents a well rounded and surveyed syllabus that prepares youto be an ideal employee for the future. Equipped with a wide array of knowledge across many different forms of I.T. and the interpersonal skills required to be a success.

During my studies I hope to not only learn more skill sets within the I.T. umbrella but also gain more insight as to who I want to be and work as, in the future. I want to gain more insight into careers in I.T., how to progress, learn must have skills and avoid those you can do without.
